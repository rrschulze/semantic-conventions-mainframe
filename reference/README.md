# Semantic Conventions Mainframe Reference Implementations

Validates OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Mainframe <!-- TODO [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Mainframe](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/mainframe/) -->
against representative, synthetic telemetry, showing entities and attributes supported for supported feature of the mainframe, software and infrastructure.

Each feature under scenarios <!-- TODO[scenarios/](scenarios/) contains a small reference implementation -->
(`scenario.py`) that exercises the SDK against a deterministic local mock server
and emits OpenTelemetry spans, metrics, and logs. The tooling validates the
captured telemetry against the semantic conventions in [../model/](../model/)
using [OTel Weaver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver) and writes the
per-library results to `scenarios/<library>/data.json`, which feed the status
reports below.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to run scenarios and add new libraries.
