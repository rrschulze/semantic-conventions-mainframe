# Releasing

Releases are cut from `main` and published as GitHub Releases with the
publication manifest and resolved schema attached as assets. The dev channel
uses tags of the form `vX.Y.Z-dev`; the schema URL lives under
`https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/mainframe-dev/X.Y.Z-dev`.

1. Open a release-prep pull request that:
   - Bumps the top-level `schema_url` in [model/manifest.yaml](model/manifest.yaml)
     to the new version (e.g. `https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/mainframe-dev/0.23.0-dev`).
   - Renders [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) from the fragments in
     [changelog.d/](changelog.d/) and removes the rendered fragments:
     ```bash
     VERSION=$(awk '/^schema_url:/ { n = split($2, parts, "/"); print parts[n]; exit }' model/manifest.yaml)
     PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --project changelog.d --locked towncrier build --config changelog.d/towncrier.toml --yes --version "$VERSION"
     ```
2. Get the PR reviewed and merged to `main`.
3. Prepare a [draft release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-mainframe/releases/new):
   - Tag: `vX.Y.Z-dev` matching the bumped `schema_url` (choose "Create new tag on publish").
   - Description: copy the changelog entries for this version.
   - **Save as draft** — do not publish.
4. Run the [Release (dev) workflow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-mainframe/.github/workflows/release-dev.yml).
   It will attach resolved schema artifacts and publish the draft as a prerelease,
   creating the git tag at the workflow's commit.
